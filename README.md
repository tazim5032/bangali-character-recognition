# Bangla Character Recognition CNN

## Overview

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for recognizing Bangla characters. The CNN is built using the Keras library and trained on a dataset of Bangla characters.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3
- Keras
- numpy
- matplotlib

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bangla-character-recognition.git
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Prepare your dataset of Bangla characters. Ensure that your dataset is organized into appropriate directories (e.g., train and test) and that each image is properly labeled.

2. Train the CNN model:

```bash
python train.py --dataset path/to/dataset --epochs 10
```

Replace `path/to/dataset` with the path to your dataset directory and adjust the number of epochs as needed.

3. Evaluate the trained model:

```bash
python evaluate.py --model path/to/model.h5 --dataset path/to/test/dataset
```

Replace `path/to/model.h5` with the path to your trained model file and `path/to/test/dataset` with the path to your test dataset directory.

## Model Architecture

The CNN model architecture consists of the following layers:

1. Convolutional layers with ReLU activation
2. MaxPooling layers
3. Dropout layers for regularization
4. Flatten layer to convert multidimensional input into a single dimension
5. Fully connected Dense layers with ReLU activation
6. Output Dense layer with softmax activation for classification

## Training and Evaluation

The model is trained using the Adam optimizer with categorical crossentropy loss. Evaluation metrics include accuracy.

## Results

After training and evaluating the model, the performance metrics, including accuracy and loss, will be displayed.
